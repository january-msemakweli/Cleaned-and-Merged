# Eye Camp Impact Report: 2024

This report presents the impact of eight eye camps conducted in Tanzania during 2024, focusing on surgical interventions that transformed lives through restored vision. While the camps served thousands of patients with various eye care services, this analysis covers the 2,107 patients who received surgical procedures.

> **Note**: Throughout this report, "Success Rate" refers to the percentage of patients achieving functional vision (visual acuity of 6/18 or better) after surgery, based on World Health Organization standards for vision that enables independent daily activities.

## Key Impact Highlights

- **Comprehensive Care**: These camps provided screening, diagnosis, and treatment to thousands of community members
- **Surgical Interventions**: 2,107 patients received sight-restoring surgical procedures across eight eye camps
- **Vision Restoration**: 85.4% of surgical patients achieved functional vision after surgery, compared to only 13.1% before
- **Quality Outcomes**: 100% of surgical patients maintained or improved their vision following intervention
- **Cataract Impact**: 1,646 cataract surgeries performed, with 83% achieving functional vision
- **Pterygium Success**: 436 pterygium excisions performed, with 94.6% achieving functional vision

## Community Reach

The camps served diverse communities across Tanzania, with surgical interventions provided to:

- **Gender Equity**: 54.2% female (1,141) and 45.8% male (966) surgical patients, showing strong access for women
- **Age Range**: Average age of surgical patients was 63.5 years, with services reaching all age groups from children to elderly
- **Geographic Access**: Surgical patients came from 8 different districts, demonstrating outreach to underserved regions

## Conclusion

These eye camps have transformed lives in Tanzania by providing comprehensive eye care services to thousands of community members. For the 2,107 patients who received surgical interventions, the impact has been profound - with 85.4% achieving functional vision after surgery (compared to only 13.1% before). These interventions have dramatically enhanced quality of life, independence, and economic opportunity for patients and their families.

Beyond the surgical outcomes documented in this report, the camps provided critical screening, diagnosis, medication, and eyeglasses to thousands more community members, expanding access to essential eye care services in underserved regions.

The consistent success rates across different demographic groups demonstrate equitable care delivery, while the safety record (100% of patients maintaining or improving vision) highlights the quality of services provided. These eye camps represent a highly effective intervention for addressing preventable blindness in underserved communities.

## Notes

1. **Data Scope**: This report focuses on the 2,107 patients who received surgical interventions at the eye camps conducted in 2024. Thousands more patients received screening, diagnosis, medication, and eyeglasses.
2. **Success Threshold**: The World Health Organization standard of 6/18 or better was used as the threshold for functional vision.
3. **Safety**: Special cases such as evisceration procedures (8 patients) were appropriately excluded from vision outcome analyses.
4. **Data Quality**: Data entry errors were identified and corrected to ensure accurate reporting.
5. **Missing Data**: Some patients had missing age or gender information, which were excluded from the respective analyses.
