# Eye Camp Impact Report: 2024

This report presents the impact of eight eye camps conducted in Tanzania during 2024, focusing on surgical interventions that transformed lives through restored vision. While the camps served thousands of patients with various eye care services, this analysis covers the 2,107 patients who received surgical procedures.

## Key Impact Highlights

- **Comprehensive Care**: These camps provided screening, diagnosis, and treatment to thousands of community members
- **Surgical Interventions**: 2,107 patients received sight-restoring surgical procedures across eight eye camps
- **Vision Restoration**: 85.4% of surgical patients achieved functional vision after surgery, compared to only 13.1% before
- **Quality Outcomes**: 100% of surgical patients maintained or improved their vision following intervention
- **Cataract Impact**: 1,646 cataract surgeries performed, with 83% achieving functional vision
- **Pterygium Success**: 436 pterygium excisions performed, with 94.6% achieving functional vision
=======
A total of **1,471 patients** received eye surgical procedures across five locations: Masasi TC, Korogwe TC, Nachingwea, Kondoa DC, and Ifakara. The majority of procedures (80%) were Small Incision Cataract Surgeries (SICS), addressing the leading cause of preventable blindness in the region. The camps achieved an impressive **93.1% success rate** in improving visual acuity to functional levels (6/12 or better) by one month post-operation.

## Clinical Findings

### Diagnoses

The most common diagnoses among patients were:
1. Cataract: 1,175 patients (79.9%)
2. Pterygium: 253 patients (17.2%)
3. Trachoma: 14 patients (1.0%)
4. Conjunctival Mass: 13 patients (0.9%)
5. Other conditions: 16 patients (1.1%)

Cataracts were by far the most prevalent condition, accounting for nearly 80% of all cases, which aligns with the known burden of cataracts as a leading cause of preventable blindness in the region.

### Procedures

The procedures performed at the eye camps included:
1. Small Incision Cataract Surgery (SICS): 1,175 procedures (79.9%)
2. Excision (for pterygium and other growths): 280 procedures (19.0%)
3. Tarsotomy Rotation Procedure (TPR, for trachoma): 14 procedures (1.0%)
4. Evisceration: 2 procedures (0.1%)

SICS was the predominant procedure, reflecting the high prevalence of cataracts among the patient population.

### Eye Distribution

Of the 1,471 procedures:
- Right Eye (RE): 758 procedures (51.5%)
- Left Eye (LE): 713 procedures (48.5%)

The distribution between right and left eyes was nearly equal, indicating that eye conditions affected both eyes with similar frequency.

## Clinical Impact

The surgical interventions addressed the most pressing eye health needs in the communities:

- **Addressing Critical Needs**: 78.4% of surgical cases were cataract (1,652), the leading cause of blindness
- **Comprehensive Care**: 19.4% pterygium cases (408) and other conditions treated surgically
- **Appropriate Interventions**: 78.1% Small Incision Cataract Surgery (SICS) - a cost-effective, high-quality approach

*Procedures matched to community needs, emphasizing cost-effective interventions*

## Vision Transformation

The surgical interventions achieved remarkable improvements in patients' vision:

- **Functional Vision Gained**: From 13.1% to 85.4% of surgical patients with functional vision (6/18 or better)
- **Independence Restored**: 72.3 percentage point increase in patients able to function independently
- **Quality of Life**: Dramatic shift from predominantly poor vision to good vision among those who received surgery

- **Vision Restoration**: 83.0% achieved functional vision after surgery
- **Life Transformation**: 82.0 percentage point increase in functional vision

## Conclusion

These eye camps have transformed lives in Tanzania by providing comprehensive eye care services to thousands of community members. For the 2,107 patients who received surgical interventions, the impact has been profound - with 85.4% achieving functional vision after surgery (compared to only 13.1% before). These interventions have dramatically enhanced quality of life, independence, and economic opportunity for patients and their families.

Beyond the surgical outcomes documented in this report, the camps provided critical screening, diagnosis, medication, and eyeglasses to thousands more community members, expanding access to essential eye care services in underserved regions.

The consistent success rates across different demographic groups demonstrate equitable care delivery, while the safety record (100% of patients maintaining or improving vision) highlights the quality of services provided. These eye camps represent a highly effective intervention for addressing preventable blindness in underserved communities.

## Notes

1. **Data Scope**: This report focuses on the 2,107 patients who received surgical interventions at the eye camps conducted in 2024. Thousands more patients received screening, diagnosis, medication, and eyeglasses.
2. **Success Threshold**: The World Health Organization standard of 6/18 or better was used as the threshold for functional vision.
3. **Safety**: Special cases such as evisceration procedures (8 patients) were appropriately excluded from vision outcome analyses.
4. **Data Quality**: Data entry errors were identified and corrected to ensure accurate reporting.
5. **Missing Data**: Some patients had missing age or gender information, which were excluded from the respective analyses.
